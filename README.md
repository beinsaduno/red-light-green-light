<br/>
<p>I have been thinking for a long time about what I can create using the knowledge I have gained so far. The challenge for me was that everything I could code to this point had already been created, and at the same time, there was a huge gap between my knowledge I had gained so far and the ideas in my head. And so, the day came when I noticed that my girlfriend was watching a TV series with great interest and hadn't moved from the couch for a few hours. I can confirm that because I was coding at the same time, and it was typical for me to sit for hours. A fact that drives my girlfriend crazy, but that's another topic. The series was Squid Game, and a little while later, I ended up on the couch watching the first season, too. And so, the idea was born in my had that I could recreate the game Red Light, Green Light.
